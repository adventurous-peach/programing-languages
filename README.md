Code from Coursera's Programming Language course series

# What I learnt:
1. It is really important to write tests before coding the function body.
2. It is really important to understand the problem before implementing the tests.
3. To name parameters and functions appropriately... -sort of. I'm still getting the hang of it.
4. To avoid code repetition.
5. Not everything needs to be tail-recursive.
